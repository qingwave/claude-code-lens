## 🎨 Code Style Guidelines

To keep the codebase consistent and maintainable:

* Use **Vue 3 Composition API** with `<script setup>`
* Write all new code in **TypeScript**
* Use **Tailwind CSS** for styling (prefer **Nuxt UI components** when applicable)
* Extract reusable logic into **composables** (`app/composables/`)
