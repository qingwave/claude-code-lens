## What is agents-ui?

# Open-source visual orchestration for Claude Code

**If Claude Code is the _engine_, agents-ui is the _dashboard_**

agents-ui is a Nuxt 3-based visual dashboard for managing Claude Code agents, commands, skills, workflows, and plugins. It provides a GUI layer on top of the `~/.claude` directory, allowing users to create, edit, and organize their Claude Code configuration without touching markdown files directly.

It looks like a studio — but under the hood it has relationship graphs, real-time metrics, visual workflow builders, and terminal emulation.

**Manage your agents visually, not through scattered markdown.**

|        | Step            | Example                                                            |
| ------ | --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **01** | Define the agent | Create a "Senior Frontend" agent with specific instructions.       |
| **02** | Build skills    | Import or create custom tools and capabilities for your team.      |
| **03** | Run & Monitor   | Execute commands in the terminal and watch real-time metrics.      |

<br/>

> **COMING SOON: Desktop App** — Run agents-ui as a standalone desktop application for even tighter integration with your local environment.

## Problems agents-ui solves

| Without agents-ui                                                                                                                     | With agents-ui                                                                                                                         |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ❌ You edit scattered markdown files in `~/.claude` and lose track of which agent uses which skill.                                    | ✅ A single visual control layer shows you exactly how everything connects with relationship graphs.                                  |
| ❌ You have no visibility into how many tokens you're using or what the actual cost of a session is until it's over.                  | ✅ Real-time metrics surface token usage and costs as they happen, helping you stay within budget.                                     |
| ❌ Chaining agents together requires manual coordination and jumping between multiple terminal windows.                               | ✅ Visual workflow builder lets you chain agents into pipelines and inspect intermediate results easily.                               |
| ❌ Testing a new prompt or agent behavior requires re-running CLI commands and manually parsing output.                               | ✅ Agent Studio provides a clean chat interface with SSE streaming for instant feedback and debugging.                                |
| ❌ Finding and importing community skills is a manual process of cloning repos and copying files.                                     | ✅ GitHub import flow lets you point to a repo and choose which skills to import directly into your setup.                            |

## Why agents-ui is special

agents-ui handles the visual orchestration of Claude Code correctly.

|                                   |                                                                                                               |
| --------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Real-time Context Monitoring.** | Tracks tokens, costs, file changes, and tool calls as they happen in your terminal sessions.                  |
| **Visual Relationship Mapping.**  | Automatically detects links between agents, commands, and skills to build a live dependency graph.            |
| **Native Claude Code Integration.**| Built directly on top of the `@anthropic-ai/claude-agent-sdk` for authentic agent interactions.              |
| **SSE-powered Agent Studio.**     | Streams agent thinking, tool use, and text deltas for a responsive, real-time testing experience.            |
| **Workflow Visualization.**       | Models complex AI pipelines as nodes and edges, making multi-step processes easy to understand.               |
| **Zero-Config Data Layer.**       | Directly reads and writes to your existing `~/.claude` directory—no new database or account required.         |

<br/>

## What agents-ui is not

|                              |                                                                                                                      |
| ---------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Not a replacement for CLI.**| It's a GUI *companion*. You can still use the Claude CLI alongside it whenever you want.                             |
| **Not an LLM provider.**     | We don't provide models. agents-ui uses your existing Anthropic API keys and Claude Code setup.                      |
| **Not a general-purpose IDE.**| It's specifically optimized for the Claude Code ecosystem and `.claude` configurations.                              |
| **Not a hosted service.**     | agents-ui runs locally on your machine for maximum privacy and access to your local files.                           |

<br/>

## Quickstart

Open source. Self-hosted. Use your local Claude Code setup.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Ngxba/claude-code-agents-ui.git
cd claude-code-agents-ui
bun install
bun run dev
```

Open **http://localhost:3000** — agents-ui will automatically load your `~/.claude` setup.

> **Requirements:** [Bun](https://bun.sh) (recommended) or Node.js 18+

<br/>

## FAQ

**Where is my data stored?**
Everything is stored in your standard `~/.claude` directory. agents-ui reads and writes directly to those files.

**Do I need a separate Anthropic API key?**
agents-ui uses the same environment variables as your Claude Code setup. If `anthropic` is configured in your shell, agents-ui will find it.

**Can I still use the CLI?**
Yes! agents-ui is a companion. Changes you make in the UI reflect in your `.claude` files immediately, and vice versa.

**How does the relationship graph work?**
It scans your agent, command, and skill files for references to each other (like `agent:` in frontmatter or `/command` in text) and builds the graph dynamically.

<br/>

## Development

```bash
bun run dev          # Start dev server (Nuxt + SSE)
bun run build        # Build for production
bun run preview      # Preview production build
bun run typecheck    # Run TypeScript type checking
```
